# rust actix svelte

Simple setup with structured logging as opt-in at runtime. Basic vue (nuxt) structure in [/frontend](/frontend).

## Frontend Setup

Install yarn:

    npm install -g yarn

In the `/frontend` folder, do the following to install the project dependencies:

    yarn

Often, and of course initially, you also need to run:

    yarn build

To start the development server, run:

    yarn start

To build a static version of the project, which is then put in the `frontend/dist/` folder, run:

    yarn generate
